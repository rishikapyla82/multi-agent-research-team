# Multi-Agent Research Team

## Overview
This project demonstrates a collaborative AI system where multiple agents work together to perform complex research tasks. Each agent has a specific role and shares context with other agents to improve efficiency.

## Objective
To design a multi-agent workflow that simulates a real research team using AI agents.

## Agents
1. Planner Agent
   - Breaks the problem into smaller tasks
   - Organizes workflow

2. Research Agent
   - Collects information
   - Provides detailed explanations

3. Writer Agent
   - Converts research into structured content

4. Reviewer Agent
   - Improves clarity and correctness

## Workflow
Planner → Researcher → Writer → Reviewer

## Features
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Shared context system
- Structured research pipeline

## Tools Used
- GitHub
- AI Agents
- Markdown Documentation

## Future Improvements
- Add memory-based agents
- Real-time web integration
- Automated task tracking
